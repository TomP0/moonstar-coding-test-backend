#Moonstar coding test for fullstack developer

## Introduction

One of the junior team member was asked by the product owner to build a simple POC of the newsfeed similar to Facebook/ LinkedIn one.

We want to first create an api without the frontend, it will be later created by someone else.

He started working on it, but got sick and now is unavailable.

Product Owner asked you if you can complete the work.

## Backend

We want to have basic Get, GetById, Post, Put, Patch and Delete implemented.

Users should be able to create a post using text only, photo only or text and photo combined. Posts is the only entity that api should support, there are no other enitites required.

We need to follow all rest api guidelines as best as we can. The only expection is that we do not need to return descriptive error messages, but correct codes should be inplace.

## Bonus points

### Backend

- Write tests
- Implement better architecture, decouple data access layer from api layer
- Make sure we follow best REST guidelines
- Use most efficent LINQ methods, including in presupplied endpoints
- Dockerize the solution + database
- Deploy the solution to the cloud, manually or with CI/ CD pipeline
- Add OpenApi and/ or Swagger
- Wrtie a nice Readme file

Any other ideas of your choice.

## How to start

Spend as much time as you need on the test, there is no time limit, however before you start, agree on the deadline and scope of work that you would like to do with the reviewer.
